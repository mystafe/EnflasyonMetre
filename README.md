This webpageis provide a tool for comparing inflation rates over different periods of time. Here's a brief breakdown of its functionality:

Form to Select Years and Amounts: The page contains a form where users can input two different years (between 1980 and 2023) and two different monetary amounts. There are also buttons for reversing the entered dates and amounts, comparing the two dates, and resetting all input values.

Results Table: After submitting the form, the page seems to display results in a table. The table has rows for different units of currency and measures of value: time, Turkish lira (₺), U.S. dollar ($), Euro (€), gold (🪙), and wage (👷🏻). Each row presents the values for the first and second selected years, and the percentage change in that value over that period.


The footer contains some notes about the data source (The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey), the range of data (up to June 2023)
